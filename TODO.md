# Tailor To Do List

The following items are tasks that are on my radar to get completed. They are not features per se but more just things that need to get done which aren't completed yet.

- [ ] Documentation. Completely rewrite the documentation to be not only more complete but more useful
- [ ] Test coverage. Tests. Period.
